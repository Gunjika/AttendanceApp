About the Project: 

Android-based attendance application is an application available for daily student attendance in colleges and institutes. It facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the teacher for a particular class. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. Everyone can access the system by providing there valid id, password, and fingerprint. They can access modules such as viewing their own profile, student's profiles, view time table, attendance of students, and notification of absence.
In this application there are two types of user one is a student and another one is the teacher. In teacher's module teacher will make a connection using hotspot and student will join this connection. Those students who join this connection, attendance of that student will mark automatically.
